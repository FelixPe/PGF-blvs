 Remark: The make process uses libtool.
 
 To compile and install the library, do the following:
 1.		'./configure' 
 1.2	'./configure --help' : gives you more information
 2		'make' : will compile a shared and a static library 
 3. 	Install the library: make install
 
 Note:	As this build process uses libtool there is a library interface created by 
 		libtool. This interface is libpgf.la, the static library itself is in libpgf.a
 		and the shared library iteslf is in libpgf.so.x.y. All these files are needed.
